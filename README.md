# RatioChat – The Social Game That Ranks Your Personality 💬

You get **matched with people, chat for 3 minutes, and receive a Ratio Score** based on how fun, engaging, or dry you were.

📈 **The better your convos, the higher your score—and the more people want to talk to you.**

But it’s more than just chatting—it’s **leveling up your social skills, boosting confidence, and proving you can actually hold a conversation.**
