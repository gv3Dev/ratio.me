# Ratio – The Social Game That Ranks Your Personality  

You get **thrown into fast-paced group chats**, talk for **3 minutes**, and receive a **Ratio Score** based on how fun, engaging, or dry you were.  

📈 **The better your convos, the higher your score—and the more people want to talk to you.**  

But it’s more than just chatting—it’s **leveling up your social skills, boosting confidence, and proving you can actually hold a conversation.**
